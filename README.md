## Usage

### Install `copier`

If you don't have `copier` already installed, the easiest way is to install it as tool with [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```sh
uv tool install copier
```

This will install copier as a `uv` tool and you can run it directly.

### Use the template to add the devcontainer folder

In your project folder run:

```sh
copier copy gh:derico-de/copier-claude-code-devcontainer .
```
